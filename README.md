# Heart-Disease-Prediction
As per the recent study by WHO, heart related diseases are increasing. 17.9 million people die every-year due to this. With growing population, it gets further difficult to diagnose and start treatment at early stage. But due to the recent advancement in technology, Machine Learning techniques have accelerated the health sector by multiple researches. Thus, the objective of this paper is to build a ML model for heart disease prediction based on the related parameters. We have used a benchmark dataset of UCI Heart disease prediction for this research work, which consist of 14 different parameters related to Heart Disease. Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Neighbor and Decision tree have been used for the development of model. In our research we have also tried to find the correlations between the different attributes available in the dataset with the help of standard Machine Learning methods and then using them efficiently in the prediction of chances of Heart disease. Result shows that compared to other ML techniques, K Neighbor gives more accuracy in less time for the prediction. This model can be helpful to the medical practitioners at their clinic as decision support system.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104375984/232123236-1c1157e0-908f-4dde-9f43-edce74ee0c43.png)
